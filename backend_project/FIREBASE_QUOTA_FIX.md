# Firebase Quota Fix

This guide explains the fixes implemented to address Firebase quota issues on the free tier (Spark plan).

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added In-Memory Caching**: Firebase service now caches query results for 5 minutes.
2. **Implemented Exponential Backoff**: Added retry logic with increasing wait times when quota limits are hit.
3. **Reduced Default Page Size**: Changed maximum page size from 100 to 50 with warnings for sizes over 25.
4. **Added Cache Fallback**: When Firebase errors occur, falls back to cached data even if expired.

## How It Works

The caching system stores results from Firebase queries in memory for 5 minutes. This significantly reduces the number of actual Firebase operations, helping you stay within the free tier limits.

When a quota error occurs, the system will:
1. Wait a progressively longer time (exponential backoff)
2. Retry the operation up to 3 times
3. Fall back to cached data if available

## For Your Demo

### Before the Demo

1. **Test with smaller page sizes**: Use `limit=10` or `limit=20` instead of larger values.

2. **Clear the cache if needed**: If you need to ensure fresh data, run:
   ```bash
   cd NE/backend_project
   python clear_cache.py
   ```

3. **Restart your API server**: This will initialize a fresh cache.

### During the Demo

1. **Watch for quota warnings**: Check logs for warnings about large page sizes.

2. **Avoid rapid refreshes**: Especially for large data sets, as cached results will be used.

3. **If errors still occur**: Reduce the page size further or demonstrate how the system gracefully falls back to cached data.

## Code Changes

1. Modified `firebase_service.py` to add caching and retry logic
2. Updated `university.py` router to use smaller page sizes
3. Added `clear_cache.py` script for cache management

## Limitations

1. The cache is in-memory, so it's cleared when the server restarts
2. Free tier limitations still apply - this is a workaround, not a permanent solution
3. Caching means data might be up to 5 minutes old

For a long-term solution, consider upgrading to a paid Firebase plan that offers higher quotas.
